# Theoretical Aspects of Computer Graphics - Assignment Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the Graphic Assignment of the Theoretical Aspects of Computer Graphics course (COSC 44143) at the University of Kelaniya. The assignment consists of five parts related to computer graphics and virtual reality.

The solutions for each part are implemented using OpenGL, 3D modeling software (Blender), and a rendering/game engine (Unity, Unreal, or any other of your choice). The five parts are:

1. Line Segment: Implementing a two-dimensional, straight-line segment with integer, Cartesian endpoint coordinates (180, 15) and (10, 145) using appropriate OpenGL routines.

2. Bresenham Line Drawing: Implementing the Bresenham line drawing algorithm for slopes in the range 0 < m < 1.0 using OpenGL and plotting the line pixels from the left endpoint to the right endpoint.

3. 3D Model with Texture: Selecting a 3D model of your choice and rendering it with OpenGL while applying a texture.

4. Scenery with Mapping and Materials: Modeling basic scenery using 3D modeling software (Blender, Maya, 3D Max, or other) with mapping and materials. Royalty-free 3D models downloaded from the internet can also be used.

5. Virtual Reality Environment: Importing the developed 3D scenery to a rendering/game engine (Unity, Unreal, or other) and building a real-time virtual reality environment that consists of lights, shadows, reflections, refractions, sky box, clouds, sounds, and user interactions to navigate the environment.

Each part of the assignment has its own folder in this repository, containing the source code, assets, and any other relevant files. The repository is organized as follows:

- `part1`: Line Segment
- `part2`: Bresenham Line Drawing
- `part3`: 3D Model with Texture
- `part4`: Scenery with Mapping and Materials
- `part5`: Virtual Reality Environment
